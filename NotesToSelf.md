Alright so. Changes to be made

#1 Less selfaware bull. Just be professional

#2 All css in one folder.

#3 If you are going to have your resume render, keep the info in a seperate JSON. Also always do JSON instead of the .js objects, just better practice.

#4 Host images somewhere else. Even imgur is better.

#5 Figure out a design that mirrors you while keeping professional. You are tidy, meticulous and you sort your pens by size for petes sake. You can do something with that.

#6 Tighten your code AS HARD AS YOU CAN. I want this site running on the Nintendo DS browser. Also read up on @media queries for css.
