## üíªDescription
A portfolio site for Aston Dahllof. This site was built using React and is a single page application with a header, a navigation bar and a footer. Between the navigation bar and the footer is the outlet that provides content to the user depending on buttons pressed in the navigation bar. The footer contains 3 interactive buttons for social media.

In the navbar you will find a "About Me" section, a "Portfolio" section with a working carousel of projects to browse, each carrying a short description and links to their deployed states and repos. You will also have access to a contact form with validation functionallity (actual submitial functionallity to come) and finally a "Resume" section where you get a itemized list of Aston's stack and access to download his resume.
